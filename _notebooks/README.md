# Auto-convert Jupyter Notebooks To Posts


You must save your notebook with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.ipynb`.  Examples of valid filenames are:

```shell
2020-01-28-My-First-Post.ipynb
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.ipynb
```

See [Writing Blog Posts With Jupyter](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#writing-blog-posts-with-jupyter) for more details.
