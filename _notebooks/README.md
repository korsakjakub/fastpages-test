# Auto-convert Jupyter Notebooks To Posts


You must save your notebook with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.ipynb`.  Examples of valid filenames are:

```shell
2020-01-28-My-First-Post.ipynb
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.ipynb
```

See [Writing Blog Posts With Jupyter](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#writing-blog-posts-with-jupyter) for more details.

# Recommended workflow for quick changes of blog-posts

1. Go to the post's webpage
2. Open in Google Collab
3. Make changes
4. Export to github. Here, remember to place it in the same directory with the same filename, so it gets overwritten.
